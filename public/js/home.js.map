Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {\\@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__facade_lang__[\"c\" /* isPresent */])(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"e\" /* isDevMode */])() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_lang__[\"e\" /* getTypeNameForDebugging */])(value) + \"'.

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata\n * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of\n * time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {\\@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

Each View can contain many View Containers.\n * <!-- /TODO -->\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Given this template...\n *\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <li *ngFor=\"let  item of items\">{{item}}</li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * We have two {\\@link TemplateRef}s:\n *\n * Outer {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\"></template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Inner {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n *   <li>{{item}}</li>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate {\\@link TemplateRef}s.\n *\n * The outer/inner {\\@link TemplateRef}s are then assembled into views like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * Count: 2\n * <ul>\n *   <template view-container-ref></template>\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->\n * </ul>\n * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * ```\n * \\@experimental\n * @abstract\n */\nexport var EmbeddedViewRef = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(EmbeddedViewRef, _super);\n    function EmbeddedViewRef() {\n        _super.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(EmbeddedViewRef.prototype, \"context\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return unimplemented(); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(EmbeddedViewRef.prototype, \"rootNodes\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return (unimplemented()); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    ;\n    return EmbeddedViewRef;\n}(ViewRef));\nexport var ViewRef_ = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _view\n     * @param {?} animationQueue\n     */\n    function ViewRef_(_view, animationQueue) {\n        this._view = _view;\n        this.animationQueue = animationQueue;\n        this._view = _view;\n        this._originalMode = this._view.cdMode;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"internalView\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"rootNodes\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.flatRootNodes; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"context\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.context; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(ViewRef_.prototype, \"destroyed\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._view.destroyed; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.markForCheck = function () { this._view.markPathToRootAsCheckOnce(); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.detach = function () { this._view.cdMode = ChangeDetectorStatus.Detached; };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.detectChanges = function () {\n        this._view.detectChanges(false);\n        this.animationQueue.flush();\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.checkNoChanges = function () { this._view.detectChanges(true); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.reattach = function () {\n        this._view.cdMode = this._originalMode;\n        this.markForCheck();\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} callback\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.onDestroy = function (callback) {\n        if (!this._view.disposables) {\n            this._view.disposables = [];\n        }\n        this._view.disposables.push(callback);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.destroy = function () { this._view.detachAndDestroy(); };\n    return ViewRef_;\n}());\nfunction ViewRef__tsickle_Closure_declarations() {\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @type {?}\n     */\n    ViewRef_.prototype._originalMode;\n    /** @type {?} */\n    ViewRef_.prototype._view;\n    /** @type {?} */\n    ViewRef_.prototype.animationQueue;\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=view_ref.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// /home/toni/sites/angular-aot/~/@angular/core/src/linker/view_ref.js\n// module id = 100\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
